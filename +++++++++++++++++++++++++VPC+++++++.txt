1. CREATE VPC, CREATE IGW WHICH IS USED TO CONNECTION B/W PUBLIC SUBNET AND INTERET.
2. CREATE 1 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SUBNETS. MENTION CIDR BLOCKS.
3. CREATE NAT GATEWAY, WHCIH PROVIDES THE INTERNET CONNECTION FOR PRIVATE SUBNET.
4. NOW CREATE 2 ROUTE TABLES FOR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC.

 VPC is a private cloud network in aws, here the workflow of vpc can be aws >> vpc ---- ip address range and subnet the ip network range for 3 projects of same company in 1 vpc >> internetgateway >> public subnet >> load balancer >> request or traffic is flowed to the route table >> in private subnet / ec2 instance we have a security check to incoming traffic known as security group .

NAT gateway is used at public subnet it is used to masking the ip addresss of private subnet or ip of our servers to prevent from hacking, if NAT is used at load balancer it is known as SNAT, if it is used at route table it is known as NAT GATEWAY.

*** DAY-5 **

sudo apt update 
python3
python3 -m http.server 8000


** In NACL inbound rules we can allow as well as deny the traffic. Rule number with less number will execute first. Even security group allows the traffic we can block it by using NACL. * is the last least number of rule.
 NACLs consist of a numbered list of rules (numbered in ascending order) that are evaluated in order from lowest to highest.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++VPC WITH PUBLIC PRIVATE SUBNETS IN PRODUCTION.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. create a VPC with public and private subnet in 2 availability zones, remove endpoints and attach natgateway 1 per az.
2. Create a template in  autoscaling group using desired capacity of 2 with ubuntu ami, without using subnet and without public ip.
3. In autoscaling select vpc and private subnets in az.s
3. Create an another server which is a bastion server, with public subnet and ip. before login use scp command and copy the pem file into it. 

**********		scp -i /c/Users/N.AKHIL\ PRABHU/downloads/practicekey.pem /c/Users/N.AKHIL\ PRABHU/downloads/practicekey.pem ubuntu@15.207.98.158:/home/ubuntu/  ************
4. Now login into bastion and log into one server,use html file run  ******************** python3 -m http.server 8000 ***********************
5. Create a application load balancer which should be facing to igw, select the vpc and public subnet in az's.  Listner port should be 80 and create a target group. target group port should be 8000.
6. use loadbalancer dns and host the webpage
